# nested_listed_exercise

Creator: Bryce Egley
Run: python nested_lists.py

NOTE: The flatten fuction in nested_lists.py is the function that satisfies the requirements of the exercise. I wrote the other functions to see time performance with large lists and test cases like 0 or 1 sized lists

Functions: 
flatten - Flattens a nested listed. You may want to give this function your own custom input, besides using my nested listed generator.

build_nested_list - randomly generates a nested list of integers

input_number - gets valid input from the user
