# nested_list_exercise

### Creator: Bryce Egley
## Run 
```python nested_lists.py```
## Test 
```python nested_lists_tests.py```

### NOTE 
The flatten fuction in nested_lists.py is the function that satisfies the requirements of the exercise. I wrote tests for the flatten function as well in nested_lists_tests.py. I wrote the other functions in nested_lists.py just to see time performance with large lists and test cases like 0 or 1 sized lists. I developed the flatten list function in jupyter_nootbooks and included my notebook in the repo

### Functions:
#### flatten
Flattens a nested listed. You may want to give this function your own custom input, besides using my nested listed generator.

#### build_nested_list
randomly generates a nested list of integers

#### input_number
gets valid input from the user
